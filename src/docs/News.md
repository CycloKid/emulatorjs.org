## EmulatorJS Version 4.0 Re-write

As of version 4.0, EmulatorJS is no longer a reverse engineered version of [https://www.emulatorjs.com/](https://www.emulatorjs.com/). I ([Ethan](https://github.com/ethanaobrien)) spent several weeks re-writing the program, making it better, faster, fixing audio, iOS/Safari support, and the core quality. The backend is actually worth working on now.

## EmulatorJS & LinuxServer

Both [Ethan O'Brien's EmulatorJS](https://github.com/EmulatorJS/EmulatorJS) and [LinuxServer's EmulatorJS](https://github.com/linuxserver/emulatorjs) had humble beginnings by seeing the service on the ad ridden [https://www.emulatorjs.com/](https://www.emulatorjs.com/) and thought, 'I could make this better.'

* EmulatorJS stuck with the original idea that is to serve as a backend used to embed the emulators into a website for maximum customizability, but also to remove ads and remove outside dependencies.

* LinuxServer on the other hand, took things a different route. Their organization's goal is to containerize applications, and in this case, they built a front end (inspired by [HyperSpin](https://hyperspin-fe.com/)) to automate creating the website and a backend ROM management system to automatically download and share artwork and media as well as update the ROM hash database for better, more accurate ROM-database linking.
